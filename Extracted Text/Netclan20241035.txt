Code Review Checklist Client:A leading IT & tech firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS Organization Size:200+ Perform analysis of all contributor’s profiles of Solana and Ethereum repository by collecting information through GitHub API then perform analysis of all random 1000 Github user’s profile. To achieve this analysis first, we need to extract each GitHub user’s data. These user data are retrieved from the most popular repository. These are the following features which will impact on good developer. From github_username will fetch the all feature as follows 1) total_repos 2) total_contribution (all repos) 3) total_forks 4) total_stars 5) total_achievements 6) popularity 7) total_code_review 8) total_issues 9) total comments popularity_score = ((((stars * weight_stars) + (forks * weight_forks) + (contributions * weight_contributions)) / max_value_among_all_repositories) * weight_popularity) impact_score = num_commits * weight_commits + num_reviewers * weight_reviewers + num_comments * weight_comments + num_issues * weight_issues ) Combined Score = Popularity Score + Impact Score Analysis of Filtered 760 users data , 790 solana and ethereum user data and 1000 random people dataset Fetching all the GitHub features from GitHub API was a time-consuming process. I solved this problem by parallel processing and creating checkpoints to save the data collected if the API limit was exceeded. Analyzing the profiles of contributors to Solana and Ethereum repositories through the GitHub API and conducting a similar assessment of random 1000 GitHub users provides critical insights for strategic decision-making, community engagement, and resource optimization. This analysis enables the identification of key contributors, assessment of project quality and sustainability, and efficient allocation of resources based on diverse skill sets. It mitigates risks associated with dependency on a few contributors, aids talent acquisition and retention, and benchmarks the platforms’ competitiveness. Additionally, it guides innovation, and compliance measures, and ensures business continuity by proactively addressing potential disruptions. Overall, this in-depth analysis serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the vitality, innovation, and longevity of blockchain projects on Solana and Ethereum. https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Abrar-Akhtar-Github-Work/tree/main/Github_Analysis_on_24_01_2024 https://www.loom.com/share/1f294d23f8cd4b81afd3302add4518c8 Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/ This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.
