Code Review Checklist The goal of this project is to build an Expert Advisor (EA) Robot that automates trading by using predictions generated from a machine learning (ML) model. The EA will operate in real-time, leveraging both historical and live data to make buy/sell decisions. Data can be obtained via two primary methods: Additionally, the EA Robot will use an MQL5 script that defines the trading strategy, enabling automated trading on any MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The core focus is to train an ML model for predictive trading, integrate data streams, and implement a scalable MQL5 strategy for execution. 4. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation _________________________________________________________________________ This approach ensures the development of a robust, data-driven EA Robot that integrates ML predictions with real-time trading platforms and APIs. It also guarantees flexibility for live trading on various currency pairs and adaptability to changing market conditions.
