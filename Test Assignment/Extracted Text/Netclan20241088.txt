as the spellchecker for OpenOffice. This library allows you to detect grammar errors and spelling mistakes through a Python script or through a command-line interface. Sentimental Analysis: For Sentimental Analysis we used FLAIR, Flair is a pre-trained embedding-based model. This means that each word is represented inside a vector space. Words with vector representations most similar to another word are often used in the same context. This allows us, to, therefore, determine the sentiment of any given vector, and therefore, any given sentence. Keywords Extraction:For keywords extraction we usedSPACYwhich is newer than NLTK or Scikit-Learn, is aimed at making deep learning for text data analysis as simple as possible. The following are the procedures involved in extracting keywords from a text using spacy. Split the input text content by tokens Extract the hot words from the token list.Set the hot words as the words with pos tag “PROPN“, “ADJ“, or “NOUN“. (POS tag list is customizable) Set the hot words as the words with pos tag “PROPN“, “ADJ“, or “NOUN“. (POS tag list is customizable) Find the most common T number of hot words from the list Our Success Stories229 What We Think178 Blackcoffer151 IT102 Artificial Intelligence53 Healthcare52 What We Do47 Big Data44 Our Success Stories What We Do What We Think How To Schedule Demo Contact
