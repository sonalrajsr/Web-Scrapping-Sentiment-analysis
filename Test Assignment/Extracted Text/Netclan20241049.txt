Department-Wise KPI Tracking Dashboard with Technician Performance Analysis for AtoZ Dependable Service
Client:A leading retail tech firm in the USA Industry Type:Retail Products & Services:Retail Businesses Organization Size:100+ The organization has some services like sales, installs and services for many departments like drain, plumbing, excavation, hvac and bath. Organization wants to track some KPIs based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise. The dashboard will show tracking the pace of KPIs so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs, revenue etc and also they want to understand  how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target. Dashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only. When an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range, department, technician to see the progress of department and technicians. When a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  auto-filtering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard. Scope of this project is limited to AtoZ Dependable Service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource. Each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity. Define attributes and entities that needed to determine all the KPIs for tracking Group KPIs in categories and subcategories. For example- as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called Service, Sales and Install. And each of these categories can be divided into 5 departments called- Drain, BATH, HVAC, plumbing and excavation. So any department will have the same KPIs for the same  category.
