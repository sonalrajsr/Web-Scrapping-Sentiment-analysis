Code Review Checklist Client:A leading IT & tech firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS Organization Size:100+ Create a cloud-based solution where clients can upload datasets, use drag-and-drop functionality to select columns for data modeling, and receive the analysis results. The data analysis will be conducted using the OpenAI API, except for the mixed model, which will be handled manually. Then later user can do the simulation to get the insight of the dataset. Develop a web-based application using frameworks like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Establish secure methods for database access and data handling. Initially, run statistical analyses using Python and update the interface with results including Mean AUC, Mean Accuracy, Mean Log-Likelihood, Coefficients with p-values, Intercept, BIC, AIC, Y_pred, Y_test, and X_test. Allow users to visualize the dataset with different charts, such as heatmaps, line charts, and actual vs. predicted values. Over time, automate these analyses by integrating Python scripts with the backend. Deploy the application on Google Cloud, ensuring the solution supports different user roles and permissions, with robust testing and scalable infrastructure. Provide features for users to perform simulations and gain insights based on the analysis results.

Databases used MongoDB Web Cloud Servers used Google Cloud Integrating R-cloud services with the backend is complex. It involves setting up secure connections and ensuring compatibility with the existing infrastructure. ChatGPT often struggles to generate complex code that meets specific client requirements. Refining prompts to improve code quality requires significant trial and error. Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of mixed models, using prompt engineering or manual methods is challenging. This often requires expert intervention to ensure accuracy. Switching from R to Python: We replaced R with Python and executed scripts on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provided better compatibility, stability, and ease of managing dependencies. Improved Prompt Engineering: To ensure ChatGPT generated accurate code, we provided specific code snippets as templates for each task. This guided the AI and improved the quality and consistency of the generated code. Handling Mixed Models: We combined manual intervention with automated checks to manage the complexity of mixed models. Although initial results sometimes required corrections, iterative testing and refinement helped improve accuracy.
