Code Review Checklist Client:A leading marketing firm in the USA Industry Type:Marketing Services:e-commerce, retail business, marketing Organization Size:100+ Build a fully Integrated BI Platform in PowerBI using native connectors and APIs(QuickBooks and Airtable) to pull real time data from many sources. For building a fully integrated BI Platform , the data has to come from the following sources to feed it to PowerBI – ·QuickBooks :An accounting software that accepts real-time business payments , manage and pay bills, manage organisation’s deposits/expenses , customers ,and payroll functions. The following data/tables has to be fetched from Quickbooks – o Customer o Invoices o Product & Services o Payments o Expenses o Deposits o Accounts o Vendors o Departments o Classes ·Airtable :An online database hybrid platform for creating and sharing relational databases with friendly user interfaces. The following databases with multiple data table has to be fetched from Airtable – o Marketing Data Analytics Base (Google Ads , Facebook Ads) o Payroll Tracking (Payroll , Hours Log) This Quickbook and Airtable real time data has to go to the powerBI service (https://app.powerbi.com). Then create useful visualisation and dashboards based on plan and feedback from the executive team. All visuals in dashboards should automatically update without any intervention to make it fully integrated. Collecting data tables from data sources : After getting these raw data tables , pipeline converts it into DataFrame , then writes/updates it into Airtable. The Pipeline is deployed in a server that runs every night , it fetches the data from QuickBooks API and writes/updates to Airtable. Scheduled Refresh :To refresh visualization/dashboard (If incoming data from Airtable API has updated) , set refresh time in powerBI service. Below are the services that we provided to client after completion of this project – PowerBI This is how we get all the data of any size from Airtable bases. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iemcyRtWPNU&ab_channel=Blackcoffer We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Demo Contact Our Success Stories IT Lifestyle & eCommerce Data Pipeline(QuickBooks to Airtable)– We have built a Data Pipeline in Python that uses quickbooks API(https://pypi.org/project/python-quickbooks/) to get raw data tables from QuickBooks and uses Airtable API (https://api.airtable.com/v0/base_key/Table_name?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY) to write/update data in Airtable. It fetches all the below raw tables after making requests to QuickBooks API – Customers , Invoices , Expenses , Deposits Accounts , Departments , Vendors etc. Airtable to PowerBI– As there is no connector available to sync data from Airtable to PowerBI. We have used pagination using DAX queries to get data from Web Sources i.e. Airtable API. Pagination fetches the data page by page using a source and offset technique set by the Airtable API developers. It successfully fetches all the below bases from Airtable API – Marketing Data Analytics Data (Google Ads , Facebook Ads) Payroll Data (Payroll , Hours Log) Preprocessing of Data –We have used DAX queries to prepare and process the raw data coming from Airtable like – Split data , typecast data Filter data (fill missing values , delete irrelevant rows etc.) Create visualizations/Dashboards– We have used following techniques to create visualizations – Used M code queries to extract useful/desired data Used measure to perform calculations on data Use a calculated table to create a relationship between two tables. Used data joining (Union , Intersection) to get desired data Deployed Data Pipeline: A Data Pipeline connecting QuickBooks to Airtable to sync in the following data tables – Customers Invoices Product & Services Expense Deposits Payments Accounts Vendors Departments Classes QuickBooks Data Dashboard: It contains following visualizations – KPIs – Total Revenue Total Spend Total Profit Profit Margin No. of Customer Line Charts – Revenue/Expense over days Bar Charts – Revenue & Expenses by Businesses Profit/loss by Businesses Revenue & Expense by Class Profit/loss by Class Pie Chart Expenses by Category Paid/Unpaid Invoices Tables – [Class , Business , Revenue , Spend , Profit , Profit Margin) [Customer , Balance , Due(in days)] [Customer , Balance , OverDue] [Account , QuickBooks Balance] Filters/Slicer – Transaction Date Business Class Marketing Analytics (Facebook Ads) Dashboard– KPIs – All Impressions Total Reach Total Link Clicks Average CPM Amount Spent on Ads Total Budget Budget Left Line Charts – Avg.

But that is not the case , it usually expires within 2 to 4 days depending on how frequently we access the API. In that case our deployed Pipeline does not work if the token expired. Getting data from Airtable to PowerBI: As PowerBI has no Airtable data source connector to fetch data from Airtable , we did use Web Source connector using Airtable data web links. It only fetches the 1st page that is 100 rows from Airtable base because Airtable API gives only 100 rows/request. Dynamic Data Source Refresh Issue: As the URL of Airtable bases data changes based on the size of data. PowerBI recognizes it as Dynamic Data Source , hence it gives the error “Dynamic Data Source Refresh Error” in PowerBI Service. QuickBooks Refresh Token Expired Issue: As the token may expire anytime after 2 days , so to resolve this we have added a gui element in Pipeline so that if token expires a pop up will appear asking for a new refresh token , until the consumer enters a valid new token from their QuickBook developer account , a pop up will keep coming and pipeline will be paused. Once the user enters a new token , the pipeline will continue working. Getting data from Airtable to PowerBI: To resolve this issue , we have used Pagination technique as below – First request Airtable API with proper URL , api_key and blank_offset (data_url?API_KEY=api_key?OFFSET=blank_offset) This request returns first 100 rows of data and a new offset value Now replace the previous offset value with a new offset value in the URL , and again make an API request. This request will return the next 100 rows of data and a new offset. Do this until you get a null offset (null offset means , all data has been fetched) Dynamic Data Source Refresh Issue: The above mentioned Pagination technique converts dynamic URLs of Airtable bases data into static URLs. So PowerBI gives no error as it has been converted to a static data source. Now the client can refresh the dashboard manually by clicking the refresh button or can set automatic refresh daily at some given time.
