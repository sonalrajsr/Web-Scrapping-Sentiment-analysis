PowerBI REST API â€“ Fetching Dataflow and Refresh Schedules with semantic models
Client:A leading IT & tech firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS Organization Size:200+ Our client, a large enterprise, faced significant challenges in managing their Power BI dataflows, datasets, and refresh schedules across multiple workspaces. The manual processes were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked real-time monitoring capabilities. They needed an automated solution to streamline these tasks, ensure data accuracy, and improve overall efficiency. We developed an automated system using Python that integrated with the Power BI API to manage and monitor dataflows, datasets, and their refresh schedules. The solution provided a comprehensive overview of all workspaces, datasets, and dataflows, including detailed transaction data and refresh schedules. This system allowed the client to efficiently track and manage their Power BI environment, reducing manual effort and improving data reliability. Data Retrieval: Data Processing: Data Storage: Authentication Issues: Ensuring secure and reliable authentication with Power BI API. API Rate Limits: Handling Power BI API rate limits and managing large volumes of data. Data Consistency: Ensuring data consistency and accuracy across multiple API calls and processing steps. Excel File Management: Efficiently managing and updating large Excel files with multiple sheets. Authentication Issues: API Rate Limits: Data Consistency: Excel File Management: The automated system significantly reduced the manual effort required for managing Power BI dataflows and datasets. It improved data accuracy, provided real-time monitoring capabilities, and allowed the client to focus on data analysis and decision-making rather than data management. The solution also enhanced overall operational efficiency and reliability. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lcsMt9v8_apAwuhxCqsNkrOgrVTdnWjO?usp=sharing https://www.loom.com/share/361634e2bb014c7f9f3fd8a3fa668d62?sid=e5fa482e-2061-4195-ac7d-c9c502bc4424 Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/ This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.
