AI-Driven Backend for Audio-to-Text Conversion and Analytical Assessment in Pharmaceutical Practice
Client:A leading pharma tech firm in the USA Industry Type:Pharma Products & Services:Pharma Tech Consulting Organization Size:100+ The primary challenge is developing a backend model for an application that captures audio responses from students and employs AI to analyze the content. The backend must perform several critical functions: Convert audio to text. Transform the text into analytics KPIs. Manage login/logout operations. Handle analytics API calls. Calculate the cosine similarity of the student’s response with the expected response. To address this problem, we propose using Python for backend development, leveraging several key steps: Audio to Text Conversion: Utilize the SpeechRecognition library in Python for converting audio inputs into text. This library is known for its ease of use and flexibility, acting as a wrapper for several popular speech APIs 35. Text Analysis: Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the converted text, including sentiment analysis, readability analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). Libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy will be used for these purposes. User Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system using JWT tokens to manage login and logout operations. API Creation: Use Flask, a lightweight Python framework, to create APIs for managing user sessions and handling analytics data. Data Storage: Employ a relational database like PostgreSQL to store user session data, user profiles, and analytics data. Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud. The architecture of the solution involves a backend model developed using Python, APIs for managing user sessions and analytics data, a secure user authentication system, and capabilities for converting audio to text and performing text analysis. AWS/Google Cloud. This project is aligned with the organization’s strategic goals, and the business impact analysis will ensure that potential disruptions are identified and managed effectively.
