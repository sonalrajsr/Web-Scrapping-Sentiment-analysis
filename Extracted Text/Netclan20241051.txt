Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech development firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Services, Product Development Organization Size:100+ Create an analytics dashboard using pdf parsing pipeline Businesses often deal with vast amounts of unstructured data stored in PDF documents, such as invoices, reports, contracts, and financial statements. Extracting meaningful insights from these documents manually is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Without an efficient system, it becomes challenging to transform unstructured PDF data into actionable insights, leading to inefficiencies in decision-making and delayed business processes. The problem is further compounded when trying to integrate this data into real-time analytics platforms or dashboards. Organizations need a streamlined process to automatically extract, clean, and analyze the information from PDFs and display it in an intuitive dashboard for immediate insights. The solution must focus on building a robust PDF parsing pipeline that automates the process of extracting and transforming data from PDFs into a dynamic analytics dashboard for faster and more accurate decision-making. Data Science Tasks: 1. **PDF Parsing Pipeline:** – Use libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Camelot to extract data from PDF documents. – Implement logic to handle different PDF layouts and extract relevant information efficiently. 2. **Data Preprocessing:** – Clean and preprocess the extracted data to handle noise, missing values, and inconsistencies. – Convert extracted data into a structured format (e.g., pandas DataFrame) for further processing. 3. **Formula Calculation:** – Implement formulas or algorithms to perform calculations on the preprocessed data. – Calculate derived metrics, perform aggregations, or apply statistical analyses to derive insights. Backend Tasks (Flask API): 1. **Setup Flask Application:** – Create a Flask application to serve as the backend API. – Define routes to handle incoming requests and serve processed data. 2. **PDF Parsing and Preprocessing:** – Implement PDF parsing pipeline within Flask application. – Preprocess the extracted data, including cleaning, normalization, and structuring. 3. **Formula Calculation:** – Implement endpoints in Flask API to perform formula calculation on the preprocessed data. – Expose API endpoints to serve calculated metrics to the frontend. 4. **Data Serving:** – Serve processed data and calculated metrics to the frontend through API endpoints. – Ensure proper error handling and response formatting for API requests. 5. **Authentication and Authorization:** – Handle authentication and authorization if required. – Implement user authentication mechanisms to secure API endpoints. 6. **Deployment:** – Deploy Flask API to a hosting service like AWS. – Configure server environment and ensure the backend API is accessible over the internet. Frontend Tasks (React.js): 1. **Setup React.js Application:** – Create a React.js application to serve as the frontend interface for the analytics dashboard. – Use Create React App or similar tools to bootstrap your React project. 2. **API Integration:** – Fetch data from the Flask API endpoints using Fetch API. – Handle responses and update React components with fetched data. 3. **Formula Calculation:** – Integrate formula calculation results into React components to display calculated metrics. – Update UI elements dynamically based on formula calculation outcomes. 4. **Data Visualization:** – Create interactive data visualizations using libraries like Chart.js, Plotly.js, or D3.js. – Render charts, graphs, or other visualizations based on the processed data and calculated metrics. 5. **User Interaction and Navigation:** – Implement user interaction features such as dropdowns, filters, and date pickers. – Handle navigation between different dashboard pages or views within your React application. 6. **State Management:** – Manage application state using React’s built-in state or state management libraries like Redux. – Keep track of data fetched from the backend API, user interactions, and application state changes. 7. **Deployment:** – Deploy React.js frontend to a static hosting service. – Build your React application for production and configure deployment settings as needed. 1. Frontend (React.js): – **Components**: Create React components for different parts of the dashboard, such as data visualization, user interaction elements, and navigation. – **API Integration**: Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to Flask API endpoints from the React frontend. Fetch data from backend API endpoints for display in the dashboard components. – **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries like Chart.js, Plotly.js, or D3.js to create interactive data visualizations within React components. Render charts, graphs, or other visualizations based on the data fetched from the Flask API. – **User Interaction**: Implement user interaction features such as dropdowns, filters, and date pickers to allow users to customize their analytics views. Handle user input and update dashboard components accordingly. – **State Management**: Manage application state using React’s built-in state management or state management libraries like Redux. Keep track of data fetched from the backend API, user interactions, and application state changes. – **Deployment**: Deploy the React.js frontend to a static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel. Build the React application for production and configure deployment settings as needed. 2. Backend (Flask API): – **Flask Application**: Create a Flask application to serve as the backend API for the analytics dashboard. – **API Endpoints**: Define routes in the Flask application to handle incoming requests from the frontend and serve processed data. Implement endpoints for PDF parsing, preprocessing, formula calculation, and data serving. – **PDF Parsing Pipeline**: Implement PDF parsing pipeline within the Flask application using libraries like PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or Camelot. Extract data from PDF documents and preprocess it for further analysis. – **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the extracted data to handle noise, missing values, and inconsistencies. Convert extracted data into a structured format (e.g., pandas DataFrame) for further processing. – **Formula Calculation**: Implement formulas or algorithms to perform calculations on the preprocessed data. Calculate derived metrics, perform aggregations, or apply statistical analyses to derive insights. – **Data Serving**: Serve processed data and calculated metrics to the frontend through API endpoints. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting for API requests. – **Authentication and Authorization**: Handle authentication and authorization if required. Implement user authentication mechanisms to secure API endpoints. – **Deployment**: Deploy the Flask API to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS. Configure the server environment and ensure the backend API is accessible over the internet. 3. Integration: – **API Communication**: Enable communication between the frontend and backend by making HTTP requests from React components to Flask API endpoints. Fetch data from backend API endpoints and update the frontend components with fetched data. – **Data Flow**: Ensure smooth data flow between the frontend and backend, with proper handling of data formats, errors, and exceptions. – **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with errors and exceptions that may occur during data fetching, processing, or communication between frontend and backend. – **Testing and Debugging**: Test the integration between frontend and backend components to ensure proper functionality and identify any issues or bugs that need to be addressed.
