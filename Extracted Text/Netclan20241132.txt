Demo Contact Our Success Stories IT Lifestyle & eCommerce Job Data Tag Data Team Member Data Team Data Data Pipeline (FieldPulse to GCP MySQL): We have created a Data Pipeline that uses web scraping to fetch data from FieldPulse. It makes a GET request to the FieldPulse API , and the API returns raw data. Convert this into json format then in Dataframe. Now , create new tables in GCP MySQL and insert/update the data accordingly. Insertion & Updation of Data : Insertion :If any data fetched from Fieldpulse is not present in their respective database table , then insert that data in the table. Updation :If any data fetched from Fieldpulse is present in their respective database table , then update that data in the table. Deploy the above Data Pipeline in GCP VM instance: Deploy the above data pipeline in GCP VM so that data gets updated every hour from FieldPulse to MySQL. Connecting GCP MySQL to Google Data Studio: Connect GCP MySQL to GDS as follows – Open a new report Click on add data Choose MySQL connector Enter following fields : Host Name or IP :xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Database :xyz Username :xyz Password :********** Enable SSL Uploadserver-ca.pemcertificate Uploadclient-cert.pemcertificate Uploadclient-key.pemcertificate Click Authenticate Add whatever table you want Build Visualization Deployed Data Pipeline in GCP: A Data Pipeline connecting FieldPulse(https://webapp.fieldpulse.com/) to GCP MySQL that is deployed on a client’s GCP VM instance. It updates the data in MySQL every hour. It extracts the following data tables from FieldPulse – Job Data Tag Data Team Member Data Team Data Maintaining a log file in Google Cloud :There is a log file in cloud to resolve unexpected error quickly if any , log file stores following details – last pipeline synced time Error type if any Error location if any Work Order Data : Job id Work order no. Tags titles Start_time Job_type Created By Status Invoice_status Assigned teams name Project_id Assignment_count Assignable_type Notes Customer_notes Customer_first_name Customer_last_name Location Assigned_team_members name End_time created_at Job Tag Data : Tag ids Company_id Mongo_id Title (Tag name) Type Color Created_at Updated_at deleted_at Setup to Connect GCP MySQL to Google Data Studio(GDS): Provided a setup to connect GCP MySQL to GDS easily. Client can access his live data from MySQL to GDS and make visualizations out of it. Python Web Scraping MySQL Programming in Python Data Structure & Algorithm Web Scraping File Handling Google Cloud Google Data Studio Getting Data from FieldPulse :As there is no open source package/library in Python for accessing Fieldpulse API , we struggled a lot to get the desired data from FieldPulse. Setting Up Connection from GCP MySQL to GDS :Due to firewall and VPN , connection was not set up as IP address changes while using VPN. It was showing an error every time someone tries to connect to MySQL from their Google Studio account. Getting Data from FieldPulse :We did use web scraping for this. We explored all the API addresses. We connected to each possible address and got the data then explored the data. Made a list of addresses which contains data of our interest. Also data is stored in a scattered and cascaded manner in FieldPulse with ids. So , we had to fetch a lot of extra tables and then join multiple tables to get a desired data table. Setting Up Connection from GCP MySQL to GDS :To resolve this issue , we did as below – set up the IP address in GCP MySQL security to 0.0.0.0 , so that any system can access it. (VPN issue resolved) Enabled the SSL in GCP MySQL.
